# Timed-quiz

The goal of this project is to put HTML, CSS and JS into action. Through 4 weeks I´ve gathered enough knowledge to be able to build a simple web app/page from scratch.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

To complete the above acceptance criteria I started by rendering a basic UX/UI with Figma in order to visualize the main elements needed to complete the requirement.

My first step was to create a repository with CSS, HTML and JS files. After this I started to work on 2 HTML files, style.css and reset.css.

The next step will be to add logic to the pege with JS.

For the final delivery I´m considering the following:
- HTML and CSS Accesibility and optimization
- Responsive user interface
- Properly working JS logic?

Some of the concepts/elements used:
- CSS media queries fro responsivenes
- em,vwm RELATIVE*
- Objects
- Data storage*
